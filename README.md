# wpress Extractor for .NET

Written in C#, inspired by [ofhouse/wpress-extract](https://github.com/ofhouse/wpress-extract) and [fifthsegment/Wpress-Extractor](https://github.com/fifthsegment/Wpress-Extractor)

.NET 9, and added an optional second argument to specify output directory

## Usage

```cmd

wpressextract "C:\tmp\website.wpress" "C:\tmp\website"

```

I haven't tried it on Mac/Linux but it should be functional as long as .NET is installed.
